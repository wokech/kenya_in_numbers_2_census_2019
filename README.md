# Kenya Census (2019) Insights
## The goal of this project is to generate insightful visualizations from the Kenya Population and Housing Census (2019)

### All data are obtained from:
1) 2019 Kenya Population and Housing Census
2) Shelmith Kariuki (2020). rKenyaCensus: 2019 Kenya Population and Housing Census Results. R package version 0.0.2.

### Visualization 1 - Kenyan Generations by Presidential Era (2019)
### [Code](https://github.com/wokech/kenya_census_2019_insights/blob/main/R_scripts/pop_gen_scripts/knbs_pop_generation_2019.R)
In this visualization, I look at the Total Kenyan Population by Generation. 
Here, Kenyans are classified into 5 generations (Pre-Independence, Kenyatta I, Moi, Kibaki, and Kenyatta II)
